# Binary Spectrum

**Binary Spectrum** is an interactive iPad game designed to teach core computer science concepts to middle school students through storytelling, mini-games, and playful experimentation. The app uses a gender-sensitive, inclusive design to appeal to a broad range of learners and promote computational thinking beyond just coding.

## 🧠 Overview

Binary Spectrum introduces foundational computing ideas through three themed mini-games inspired by popular unplugged activities. The app blends artistic expression with logic-based challenges, making abstract CS concepts tangible and fun. It’s ideal for informal learning environments like coding clubs, workshops, or classrooms.

### 🎯 Educational Focus
- Computational Thinking  
- Binary Representation  
- Digital Image Encoding  
- RGB Color Systems & Transparency

## 🎮 Mini-Games

## 🏗 Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture for clarity and maintainability:

- **Models**: Data structures and business logic
- **Views**: UI components and screens
- **ViewModels**: State management and view logic
- **Services**: Cross-cutting concerns (sound, haptics, navigation)
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Extensions**: Swift language extensions
